            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
               Hi, I am Ujjwal Shukla, a passionate and results driven Product Manager with over 3 years of experience across Product Development specializing in building and scaling API, AI, and SaaS driven products in both B2B SaaS and B2C ecosystems. Over the past 3 years, I have worked in high velocity startups ranging from bootstrapped to Series A funded environments, where I played a key role in end to end product development, growth, and scale, including leading products from ideation to more than 75,000 users within first 20 months.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional journey began with an MBA from IIT Kanpur and a B.Tech from IET Lucknow, equipping me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. With over three years of experience in Product Management and Analytics, I bring a strategic mindset, data-driven decision-making, and hands-on execution to drive impactful products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I work at an API first product company, where I design and test scalable APIs, optimize product flows using Mixpanel event analysis, and collaborate closely with engineering and design teams to deliver high quality, reliable products. I have led the launch and scale of data and AI driven solutions such as the Social Screening product, leveraging retrieval augmented generation, vector embeddings, and semantic intelligence to power automated content verification and insight generation. Alongside deep product execution, I bring strong experience in product marketing and user acquisition, ensuring products are not only well built but also effectively positioned to drive engagement, adoption, and measurable business impact.            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, I have honed my skills in various aspects of product management, including:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Roadmap & Strategy:</strong> Defined and executed product roadmaps, balancing short-term feature releases with long-term strategic goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Requirement Documents (PRDs):</strong> Authored detailed PRDs and wireframes, ensuring feature clarity, seamless execution, and business alignment.</li>
                <li><strong>API Development & Testing:</strong> Designed, tested, and optimized RESTful APIs with robust request/response structures, error handling, and versioning.</li>
                <li><strong>User Story Writing:</strong> Created structured, actionable user stories to drive development, improve prioritization, and enhance product usability.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Analytics:</strong> Leveraged SQL, GA4, Mixpanel, and Power BI to track user behavior, optimize funnels, and drive data-backed growth strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitor Research:</strong> Conducted in-depth market analysis to identify gaps, optimize product positioning, and stay ahead in the competitive landscape.</li>
                <li><strong>A/B Testing & Experimentation:</strong> Designed, executed, and analyzed A/B tests to validate hypotheses, improve conversions, and refine product features.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth Strategies:</strong> Developed and executed high-impact acquisition, engagement, and retention strategies across B2B and B2C markets.</li>
                <li><strong>User Engagement & Feedback:</strong> Conducted 150+ user interviews and feedback sessions to shape roadmap priorities and enhance user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Insights:</strong> Analyzed user journeys, drop-offs, and interaction patterns to drive data-informed product improvements and feature enhancements.</li>
            </ul>            
            <p>
                I have a strong ability to make data-driven decisions, conduct A/B testing, and analyze user behavior to drive product success. My expertise spans product development, API testing, roadmap planning, stakeholder collaboration, and go-to-market execution. Additionally, I am proficient in a range of tools and technologies essential for modern product management and digital marketing. These include Power BI for data visualization, SQL for database management, Jira for project tracking, GA4 for analytics, Klaviyo for email marketing, and Google Ads and Meta Ads for digital advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion for product management is driven by a constant desire to learn and adapt. This enthusiasm keeps me ahead in the ever-evolving field of digital marketing and product management, ensuring I can contribute effectively to any team or project.
            </p>
            <p>
                At NeenOpal, I leveraged data analytics to optimize business strategies, while at Phyllo, I worked extensively on API products—conducting API testing, analyzing Mixpanel events, and refining product flows to enhance user engagement.
            </p>
